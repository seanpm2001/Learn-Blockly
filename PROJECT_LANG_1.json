{"About:"}
{"I decided to make Blockly the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Blockly) as Blockly is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Blockly programming language. It only makes sense to Blockly the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."}
